# EncryptOrCry
The password manager to rule them all

<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>A password manager. </p>

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Server-less</li>
  <li>PGP + AES encryption</li>
  <li>Lightweight and fast!</li>
</ul>

<h1>How do you secure my passwords?</h1>
<p>The entries are first placed in a json file.</p>
<p>The json file then gets encrypted with AES using a random password.</p>
<p>This random password gets encrypted using your pgp key and is saved in an encrypted form.</p>
<p>Every time you close the program a new password is generated.</p>
